<h2><strong>4.Improve the position of your pieces</strong>.</h2>
<p>Once you have finished the development, look for better squares for your pieces. Imagine the ideal squares for them and see if you can find a way of achieving that set-up. When placed on good, central squares, pieces cooperate better with each other and it will be easier for you to start creating an attack or find ways to harm your opponent’s position.</p>
<h2><strong>5.Pieces first, pawns second</strong>!</h2>
<p>This is something you should already know if you are a constant reader of our articles. Before launching an attack with pawns, make sure you have ticked the previous point. Pawns need to have support and this is provided by pieces. If your pieces are still badly placed and lack harmony, an attack based only on pawns will usually not succeed.</p>
<h2>6.Controlling the pawn chains</h2>
<p>Pay attention to the center and the existing <strong>pawn chains</strong>. This theory, developed by <a href="/articles/openings/philidor-defense-all-you-need-to-know/">Philidor</a>, indicates that the correct use of the two can help you win space and activate your pieces. Also, knowing how to “read” the central pawn chains can help you find and build the correct plan. If you want to know more about this, make sure to read our <a href="https://thechessworld.com/articles/middle-game/pawn-structures-and-attacks/">previous article</a> on this subject.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;7.<strong>Create weaknesses</strong></h2>
<p>in your opponent’s camp and <strong>accumulate small advantages</strong>. As Steinitz pointed out, there are a number of important positional elements that should be taken into account during the game. Try to take advantage of the weak points (squares or pawns) in your opponent’s structure, control the existing open files and look for other small pluses such as the <a href="/articles/middle-game/bishop-pair-5-things-to-know/">bishop pair</a> or better piece mobility and cooperation.</p>
<h2><strong>8.The principle of the two weaknesses</strong></h2>
<p>This principle is the&nbsp;most important one to remember in positions when you’re trying to materialize an advantage, either material or positional.</p>
<p>The main idea behind it is that if your opponent will only have one problem to solve, such as defending a weakness, this will most of the times be easy to achieve and you will soon run out of bullets. However, if you can create another front of the attack and accumulate one more advantage, then he will run out of defensive resources and his position will most likely collapse. Learn more about this principle in <a href="/articles/middle-game/principle-two-weaknesses/">this article</a> that we wrote a while ago.</p>
