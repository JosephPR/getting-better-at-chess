<h1><strong><u>Opening</u></strong></h1>
<p>From a very early moment in our chess journey, we are being explained the importance of the chess Open and that we should always use them as a guideline during our games. While chess has developed a lot in recent years and the use of engines has encouraged play based sometimes solely on calculation, the classics remain very much alive and we still need to use their past wisdom in order to call ourselves complete players.</p>
<p>Here are some of those basic principles that every player should know, grouped on the 3 phases of the game.</p>
<p><span id="more-11275"></span></p>
<h2>1.Develop quickly</h2>
<p><strong>Develop your pieces</strong> as quickly as possible and get your king into safety. This is one the first rules we are being told when learning the game and one that we keep obeying throughout our entire chess life. It is probably safe to say that development is the most important concept and ignoring it usually leads to awful consequences. After all those years, players still have it clear: develop and castle!</p>
<h2><strong>2.Save tempi</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Don’t waste tempi</strong> in the opening. Here we include the famous “<strong><em>don’t move the same piece twice in the opening</em></strong>” and “don’t make too much (unnecessary) pawn moves in the opening”. The point is quite simple – it leads to getting behind in development.</p>
<p>The same logic applies to the well-known “<strong><em>don’t get your queen out in the opening</em></strong>” rule, although in this case there are a number of well-known examples (like <a href="/articles/openings/the-3qa5-scandinavian-play-it-safely-and-aggressively/">the Scandinavian</a>) that show us this is sometimes acceptable. However, the main point is this – if it is not necessary and your opponent can attack it, the queen is usually between the last pieces to develop.</p>
<h2><strong>3.Control the center</strong></h2>
<p>The whole game is a fight for the center and it starts from the very beginning with developing the pieces towards the center. They are not only more active if they are placed on the central square, but at the same time, they limit your opponent’s activity.</p>
