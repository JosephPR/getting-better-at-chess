<h2><strong>9.Centralize your king</strong></h2>
<p>In the endgame, the king becomes a strong piece and it is important to br/ing it towards the center. It helps attack the pawns and put pressure on your opponent’s position. Most of the times the side with the stronger king ends up winning the endgame.</p>
<h2><strong>10.Activity over material advantage</strong></h2>
<p>Having active pieces becomes even more important in the endgame. Take as an example the rook endgames where sometimes it is worth sacrificing a pawn in order to activate your own pieces – the <strong>rook and the king</strong>. Even down material, this is usually enough to at least achieve a draw, if not even win the game.</p>
