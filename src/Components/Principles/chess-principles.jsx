  <h1>75 Chess Principles</h1>

      <div className="principles" xs="2">
        <p>1. Develop your chess pieces quickly. Develop your knights and bishops, and castle early to develop a rook.</p>
        <p>2. Control the center as fast as you can with pawns and minor pieces.</p>
        <p>3. Try to put your pieces on squares that give them maximum space and less vulnerable to attack.</p>
        <p>4. Try to develop your knights towards the center.</p>
        <p>5. A knight on the rim is dim. But there are exceptions.</p>
        <p>6. Don’t take unnecessary chances. Play solid chess.</p>
        <p>7. Play aggressive, not passive.</p>
        <p>8. Calculate forced moves first.</p>
        <p>9. Always ask yourself, “Can he put me in check or win a piece or pawn?”</p>
        <p>10. Have a plan. Every move should have a purpose.</p>
        <p>11. Assume your opponent’s move is his best move.</p>
        <p>12. Ask yourself, “Why did he move there?” after each opponent move.</p>
        <p>13. Play for the initiative and try to control the board.</p>
        <p>14. If you must lose a piece, get something for it if you can.</p>
        <p>15. When behind, exchange pawns. When ahead, exchange pieces.</p>
        <p>16. If you are losing, don’t give up fighting. Look for counter play.</p>
        <p>17. Don’t play unsound moves unless you are losing badly.</p>
        <p>18. Don’t sacrifice a piece without good reason.</p>
        <p>19. If you are in doubt of an opponent’s sacrifice, accept it.</p>
        <p>20. Attack with more than just one or two pieces if you can.</p>
        <p>21. Do not make careless pawn moves. They cannot move back.</p>
        <p>22. Do not block in your bishops. Keep them active.</p>
        <p>23. Bishops of opposite pors have the greatest chance of drawing.</p>
        <p>24. Try not to move the same piece twice or several times in a row.</p>
        <p>25. Exchange pieces if it helps your development.</p>
        <p>26. Don’t br/ing your queen out early and allow it to be attacked.</p>
        <p>27. Castle soon to protect your king and develop your rook.</p>
        <p>28. Develop rooks to open files.</p>
        <p>29. Put rooks behind passed pawns.</p>
        <p>30. Study rook endgames. They are the most common and most complicated.</p>
        <p>31. Don’t let your king get caught in the center unless it is the endgame.</p>
        <p>32.  One of the best ways to learn is to subject your own games to intensive analysis.</p>
        <p>33. After castling, keep a good pawn formation around your king.</p>
        <p>34. If you only have one bishop, put your pawns on its opposite por.</p>
        <p>35. Trade pawns pieces when ahead in material or when under attack.</p>
        <p>36. If cramped, free your game by exchanging material.</p>
        <p>37. If your opponent is cramped, don’t let him get any freeing exchanges.</p>
        <p>38. Study openings you are comfortable with.</p>
        <p>39. Play over entire games, not just the opening.</p>
        <p>40. Blitz chess is helpful in recognizing chess patterns. Play often.</p>
        <p>41. Study annotated games and try to guess each move.</p>
        <p>42. Stick with just a few openings (2 or 3) with White and Black</p>
        <p>43. Record your games and go over them, especially the games you lost.</p>
        <p>44. Show your games to higher rated opponents and get feedback from them.</p>
        <p>45. Use chess computers, engines and databases to aid your chess studies.</p>
        <p>46. Try to eliminate blunders. The champions just blunder less often.</p>
        <p>47. When it is not your move, look for tactics and combinations.</p>
        <p>48. Try to double rooks or double rook and queen on open files.</p>
        <p>49. Always ask yourself, “Does my next move overlook something simple?”</p>
        <p>50. Don’t make your own plans without the exclusion of the opponent’s threats.</p>
        <p>51. Watch out for captures by retreat of an opponent’s piece.</p>
        <p>52. Do not focus on one sector of the board. View the whole board.</p>
        <p>53. You can no longer write your move down first, then move, so make sure it is the move you wish to play.</p>
        <p>54. Try to solve chess puzzles with diagrams from books and magazines.</p>
        <p>55. It is less likely that an opponent is prepared for off-beat openings.</p>
        <p>56. Recognize transposition of moves from main-line play.</p>
        <p>57. Watch your time and avoid time trouble. Be aware of time delay and time increments in tournament play with digital clocks.</p>
        <p>58. Bishops are worth more than knights except when they are pinned in.</p>
        <p>59. A knight works better with a bishop than another knight.</p>
        <p>60. It is usually a good idea to trade down into a pawn up endgame.</p>
        <p>61. Have confidence in your game.</p>
        <p>62. Play in as many rated events as you can.</p>
        <p>63. Try not to look at your opponent’s rating until after the game.</p>
        <p>64. Always play for a win.</p>
        <p>65. Devour the games of the masters</p>
        <p>66. Play an opening first, then look up what theory there is on it.</p>
        <p>67. A wing attack is best met by a counterattack in the center.</p>
        <p>68. Do not pin your opponent&rsquo;s f3- or f6-knight to his queen with your bishop until after he&rsquo;s castled.</p>
        <p>69. Fewer pawn islands means a healthier position.</p>
        <p>70. Fewer pawn islands means a healthier position.</p>
        <p>71. You must attack when you have the superior game, or you will forfeit your advantage.</p>
        <p>72. Attacking two weaknesses on opposite sides of the board simultaneously will stretch out the defense.</p>
        <p>73. Relentlessly attack pinned pieces, weak pawns, exposed kings, and other immobile targets.</p>
        <p>74. Place your pawns on the opposite por square as your bishop.</p>
        <p>75. Focus your chess thinking.</p>
