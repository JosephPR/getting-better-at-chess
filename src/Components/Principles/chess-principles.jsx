      <Row xs="2">
        <Col>01. Develop your chess pieces quickly. Develop your knights and bishops, and castle early to develop a rook.</Col>
        <Col>02. Control the center as fast as you can with pawns and minor pieces.</Col>
        <Col>03. Try to put your pieces on squares that give them maximum space and less vulnerable to attack.</Col>
        <Col>04. Try to develop your knights towards the center.</Col>
        <Col>05. A knight on the rim is dim. But there are exceptions.</Col>
        <Col>06. Don’t take unnecessary chances. Play solid chess.</Col>
        <Col>07. Play aggressive, not passive.</Col>
        <Col>08. Calculate forced moves first.</Col>
        <Col>09. Always ask yourself, “Can he put me in check or win a piece or pawn?”</Col>
        <Col>10. Have a plan. Every move should have a purpose.</Col>
        <Col>11. Assume your opponent’s move is his best move.</Col>
        <Col>12. Ask yourself, “Why did he move there?” after each opponent move.</Col>
        <Col>13. Play for the initiative and try to control the board.</Col>
        <Col>14. If you must lose a piece, get something for it if you can.</Col>
        <Col>15. When behind, exchange pawns. When ahead, exchange pieces.</Col>
        <Col>16. If you are losing, don’t give up fighting. Look for counter play.</Col>
        <Col>17. Don’t play unsound moves unless you are losing badly.</Col>
        <Col>18. Don’t sacrifice a piece without good reason.</Col>
        <Col>19. If you are in doubt of an opponent’s sacrifice, accept it.</Col>
        <Col>20. Attack with more than just one or two pieces if you can.</Col>
        <Col>21. Do not make careless pawn moves. They cannot move back.</Col>
        <Col>22. Do not block in your bishops. Keep them active.</Col>
        <Col>23. Bishops of opposite colors have the greatest chance of drawing.</Col>
        <Col>24. Try not to move the same piece twice or several times in a row.</Col>
        <Col>25. Exchange pieces if it helps your development.</Col>
        <Col>26. Don’t br/ing your queen out early and allow it to be attacked.</Col>
        <Col>27. Castle soon to protect your king and develop your rook.</Col>
        <Col>28. Develop rooks to open files.</Col>
        <Col>29. Put rooks behind passed pawns.</Col>
        <Col>30. Study rook endgames. They are the most common and most complicated.</Col>
        <Col>31. Don’t let your king get caught in the center unless it is the endgame.</Col>
        <Col>32.  One of the best ways to learn is to subject your own games to intensive analysis.</Col>
        <Col>33. After castling, keep a good pawn formation around your king.</Col>
        <Col>34. If you only have one bishop, put your pawns on its opposite color.</Col>
        <Col>35. Trade pawns pieces when ahead in material or when under attack.</Col>
        <Col>36. If cramped, free your game by exchanging material.</Col>
        <Col>37. If your opponent is cramped, don’t let him get any freeing exchanges.</Col>
        <Col>38. Study openings you are comfortable with.</Col>
        <Col>39. Play over entire games, not just the opening.</Col>
        <Col>40. Blitz chess is helpful in recognizing chess patterns. Play often.</Col>
        <Col>41. Study annotated games and try to guess each move.</Col>
        <Col>42. Stick with just a few openings (2 or 3) with White and Black</Col>
        <Col>43. Record your games and go over them, especially the games you lost.</Col>

        <Col>45. Use chess computers, engines and databases to aid your chess studies.</Col>
        <Col>46. Try to eliminate blunders. The champions just blunder less often.</Col>
        <Col>47. When it is not your move, look for tactics and combinations.</Col>
        <Col>48. Try to double rooks or double rook and queen on open files.</Col>
        <Col>49. Always ask yourself, “Does my next move overlook something simple?”</Col>
        <Col>50. Don’t make your own plans without the exclusion of the opponent’s threats.</Col>
        <Col>51. Watch out for captures by retreat of an opponent’s piece.</Col>
        <Col>52. Do not focus on one sector of the board. View the whole board.</Col>
        <Col>53. You can no longer write your move down first, then move, so make sure it is the move you wish to play.</Col>
        <Col>54. Try to solve chess puzzles with diagrams from books and magazines.</Col>
        <Col>55. It is less likely that an opponent is prepared for off-beat openings.</Col>
        <Col>56. Recognize transposition of moves from main-line play.</Col>
        <Col>57. Watch your time and avoid time trouble. Be aware of time delay and time increments in tournament play with digital clocks.</Col>
        <Col>58. Bishops are worth more than knights except when they are pinned in.</Col>
        <Col>59. A knight works better with a bishop than another knight.</Col>
        <Col>60. It is usually a good idea to trade down into a pawn up endgame.</Col>
        <Col>61. Have confidence in your game.</Col>
        <Col>62. Play in as many rated events as you can.</Col>
        <Col>63. Try not to look at your opponent’s rating until after the game.</Col>
        <Col>64. Always play for a win.</Col>
        <Col>65. Devour the games of the masters</Col>
        <Col>66. Play an opening first, then look up what theory there is on it.</Col>
        <Col>67. A wing attack is best met by a counterattack in the center.</Col>
        <Col>68. Do not pin your opponent&rsquo;s f3- or f6-knight to his queen with your bishop until after he&rsquo;s castled.</Col>
        <Col>69. Fewer pawn islands means a healthier position.</Col>
        <Col>70. Fewer pawn islands means a healthier position.</Col>
        <Col>71. You must attack when you have the superior game, or you will forfeit your advantage.</Col>
        <Col>72. Attacking two weaknesses on opposite sides of the board simultaneously will stretch out the defense.</Col>
        <Col>73. Relentlessly attack pinned pieces, weak pawns, exposed kings, and other immobile targets.</Col>
        <Col>74. Place your pawns on the opposite color square as your bishop.</Col>
        <Col>75. Focus your chess thinking.</Col>
