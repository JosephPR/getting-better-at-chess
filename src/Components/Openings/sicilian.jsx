    <h1>Sicilian Defense</h1>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Sicilian Defense" src="https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/sicilian-big.jpg" alt="Sicilian Defense" width="250" height="250" /></p>
<p>The Sicilian Defense is the most popular defense against white&rsquo;s opening 1.e4 and is used extensively at top level play. It is a very aggressive defense and immediately stakes claim at the center, denying white the double pawns on e4 and d4. Many chess champions actually prefer to start with 1.d4 because of how well the Sicilian Defense plays against 1.e4.</p>
<p>Eventually the c-pawn of black is usually exchanged, opening the semi-open c file for black to bring his queen or rook to and add pressure to the queen side attack.</p>
<p>White not only has to worry about black&rsquo;s defense but also the counter attack that the Sicilian Defense presents. White tends to have the advantage on the king side while black will usually look to attack on the queen side.</p>
<p>For those chess players that play against the 1.e4 opening quite often, the Sicilian Defense is an opening that you should spend quite a bit of time studying. There are many variations and they each are designed for specific types of players.</p>
<p>Watch the video below to watch more detailed explanations of the opening, multiple variations, and extended lines.</p>
    <div className="line-height">
<div>The sicilian is probably the most complex defence to 1. e4!. I will try to answer you as best as I can:</div>
<br />
<div>1. The C pawn is ment to be traded for the D pawn but gives white a lead in development but my 2 vs 1 center pawn ratio wont allow him to have any early attack.</div>
<br />
<div>Answer: Yes, white's best option is to open up the centre with 2. Nf3 and 3. d4. The idea is that white has to win the middlegame, else black has a nice advantage in the endgame (more control of the centre with the pawns). However, with so active white pieces, black will have to make counterattacks. Therefor, the sicilian is often double-edged.</div>
<br />
<div>2. Its usually not a bad idea to fianchetto the bishop on g7 also known as the dragon bishop.</div>
<br />
<div>Answer: If you want to fianchetto, I advice you to either play the accelerated dragon or the dragon variation, don't combine. Dragodorf is just a worse variation of the dragon, and should only be a surprise weapon. The accelerated dragon (1. e4 c5 2. nf3 nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. nxd4 g6) is meant to be positional. However, white got this bind called Maroczy Bind (5. c4!), after which he will have a nice advantage. There is still a game, but a very positional game. The dragon is just tactics. If you like sharp games, this is not for you. If you love sharp games, you must have this in your repertoire. In the yugoslav attack (1. e4 c5 2. nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. nxd4 nf6 5. nc3 g6 6. be3 bg7 7. f3 nc6 (0-0) 8. qd2 0-0 (nc6) 9. bc4, it's all about tactics. White have this ready-made pawn storm, black has a piece attack. Whoever come first wins.</div>
<br />
<div>3. The Knight on b8 is very flexable. I can choose to put it on c6 or d7 and sometimes even a6.</div>
<br />
<div>Answer: I have never seen it to a6. Often it goes to d7 in the Najdorf, because it's well placed on either e5 or c5. In other variations, it's most common on c6, to give more control of the centre.</div>
<br />
<div>4. Im pretty sure in the main sicilians like najdorf, schvengien, dragon i castle short so i should get used to doing that.</div>
<br />
<div>Answer: Dragon: Yes. Najdorf: no. Schvenningen: i dont know. In the najdorf, black often keeps his king in the centre, since it's more safe there. Kasparov was expert in making pawn storms on both wings, and keep his king in the centre. It's not for mortals, but look at his games in the Najdorf.</div>
<br />
<div>5. The rook on a8 99% of the time end up on c8 or d8. Its just sensable.</div>
<br />
<div>Answer: Yes, black often uses the c-file for counterplay. Since that is the half-open file, and he wants to play d5, Rac8 and Rfd8 (Rhd8 sometimes) is very common.</div>
<br />
<div>6. Look for the queen side pawn storm aka minority attack.</div>
<br />
<div>Answer: YES. If you allow white to build his attack, he will mate you. Therefor, queenside counterplay is very important in the sicilian.</div>
<br />
<div>7. The knight on g8 pretty much always goes to f6.</div>
<br />
<div>Answer: Yes. Except in the original Taimanov sicilian, where Taimanov suggested Nge7. However, practice have shown that Nf6 is strongest.</div>
<br />
<div>8. What are the main pawn breaks in the opening that i am trying to achieve later on or earlier on?</div>
<br />
<div>Answer: d5. This is pretty much in every sicilian, rest pretty much depends on the sicilian variation. a6-b5 is also common (except in the dragon, it is too slow).</div>
<br />
<div>9. Are there any common knight manuevers?</div>
<br />
<div>Answer: Nd7-c5 or Nf6-d7-c5 in the najdorf. Nxg4 or Nxe4 (tactics) in the dragon. Nc6(d7)-e5 in many.</div>
<br />
<div>10. Any other common themes you can think of?</div>
<br />
<div>Answer: Rxc3, is the exchange sacrifice. If you can't play such a move, don't play the sicilian. In the dragon, this should be a candidate move when it is legal! a6-b5 and Bb7 to put pressure on e4, especially if white has playued f4. d5 breakthrough is common. For white, Nd5, N(x)e6, Nxb5, Bxb5, Qe1-g3 and other sacrificial moves. Kb1 and Kh1 is often usefull, and my score is definetly higher when I play such moves than when I don't.</div>
<br />
<div>11: i have no idea why black would play 2...d6 at all?</div>
<br />
<div>Answer: Semi-waiting move. And takes control of the imporant e5 square, and black doesn't know where the knight is best placed, c6 or d7.</div>
<br />
<div>12: What are some of white's ideas in most sicilians?</div>
<br />
<div>Mate. In Be2 variations and Maroczy, it is to get a positional game, where the player who understand the position. Often a4 after a6 to prevent or discourage b5, and often is continiues to a5 to create a hole on b6. In the english attack, g4-g5-h4-h5-g6 is quite common.</div>
<br />
<div>13: Any other reccomondations?</div>
<br />
<div>Answer: Don't play the sicilian if you don't like theory.</div>
</div>
<p>There actually is one (semi-respectable) sicilian, that really cuts down on white's options: The Nimzo-Sicilian. The Nimzo-Sicilian is characterised by the moves 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nf6!? Now 3.d4 hangs the e4 pawn &hellip; you will encounter that a lot in blitz. After 3.Nc3 there is 3&hellip;d5 leaving the usual sicilian structures behind. After 3.e5 you play 3&hellip;Nd5, where play can transpose to the Alapin. The very sharp mainline is a pawnsac 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.e5 Nd5 4.Nc3 e6 5.Nd5 ed 6.d4 Nc6 7.dc Bc5 8.Qd5 Qb6 &hellip; After 1.e4 c5 2.Nc3 you have to play 2&hellip;e6 first. Here you can chose to go for a number of variations, maybe the Kan is actually a good choice. But you have to realise that 2.Nc3 is already a concession by white: Even the accelerated dragon is now better than after 2.Nf3.</p>
<p>Now this seems like a pile of variations already, so what did you actually gain? - No Bb5-variations (and you could still transpose to the Sveshnikov!). - No Maroczy-bind: Which is a nice way to play against the Kan via 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.c4 ... - The GrandPrix-Attack (1.e4 c5 2.Nc3 &hellip;3.f4) is not as strong as against 2.d6 (because you are ready to play d5 in one move). - You can play the same move against the Alapin (2.c3 Nf6). - The Nimzo-Sicilian is very rare, so usually your opponents won't have much of a clue about it.</p>
<p>So why doesn't anybody play it? In the pawnsac-mainline the current theoretical assessment is a worse endgame for black, that probably deters GMs. But to get there white has to survive several tactical shots with a king in the middle of the board and playing this mainline isn't even forced for black!</p>
<p>I have played it for years and it usually leads to an open fight, where both sides are quickly out of book (my opponent, because the variation is so rare, and I, because I'm to lazy to prepare). To me the Nimzo Sicilian is also an transposition paradise: You can cut out a lot of options for your opponent and still often reach the Kan or Sveshnikov. It is also a pain for Bb5 or Maroczy-players, because they suddenly realise that they didn't actually solve their "sicilian problem".</p>
