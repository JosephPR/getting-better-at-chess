<p>1. d4 d5<br />2. c4</p>
<p>The objective of the queen&rsquo;s gambit is to temporarily sacrifice a pawn to gain control of the e5 square.</p>
<p>If black accepts the gambit 2&hellip;dxc4 white should reply 3. e3 which not only gives the d4 pawn an extra defender but also frees up the bishop to attack and regain the pawn. Black will have a hard time holding onto the pawn after 3&hellip;b5 4. a4 c6 5. axb5 cxb5 6. Qf3. In the Queen&rsquo;s Gambit accepted line, white is able to gain a center presence, good attacking chances and his pawn on d4 threatens to advance. Black will have to concede his pawn on c4 and focus on counter attacking white&rsquo;s advances. This is why the queen&rsquo;s gambit is not considered to be a true gambit. There are many different variations for black if he chooses to decline the gambit.</p>
<p>The video will focus on many of these variations. This is one of the most popular openings because of its attacking prowess. White will be attacking and it will be up to black to defend correctly. If you enjoy putting constant pressure on your opponent then the queen&rsquo;s gambit is a perfect opening for you. Watch the video below to watch more detailed explanations of the opening, multiple variations, and extended lines.</p>
